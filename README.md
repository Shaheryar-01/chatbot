# Avanza HR Assistant

Avanza HR Assistant is a simple yet powerful AI chatbot built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain** that helps employees easily find answers to their HR-related questions by interacting with the company employee handbook.

## Features

* 📄 Loads HR policy documents (PDFs) and builds a searchable knowledge base
* 🤖 Chat interface powered by **OpenAI GPT** models
* 🔍 Retrieves relevant document sections using **FAISS** vector search
* 🔎 Multilingual support: Responds in the language of the user's question
* 📱 Easy to deploy with Streamlit for web-based access

## How It Works

1. **PDF Download:** The app automatically downloads the employee handbook from a Google Drive link if not present locally.

2. **Document Loading & Vectorstore:**

   * Loads PDFs from the `documents/` folder
   * Splits them into manageable chunks
   * Generates embeddings using **HuggingFace**
   * Builds or loads a **FAISS** index for fast retrieval

3. **Chat with AI:**

   * The user asks a question in the chat.
   * The app retrieves relevant document chunks.
   * GPT model answers based on those chunks only (RAG approach).

4. **Persistent Chat:**

   * Chat history is stored in Streamlit's session state during the session.
